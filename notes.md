# Bugs to report
* Need @types/continuation-local-storage and @types/express for jaeger-tracer
* Docs on K8 monitoring are bad

# M2 Consider
* For the URL - consider having a TTL buffer and use shorter URLs.   Make it easier for sms channel.  
* Do we want an SMS channel - probably better to nag directly using MMS.
* P3 - Bug: if a channel doesn't work - then remove it - longer term wait for a period of time.
* Easy signin. With the new URL approach pretty easy to create a URL with a short temp user key along with a shortened URL to signin and connect it.  Later could also send a QR code so no typing required on a mobile phone.  The mobile device is likely logged in or has password stored.
* Consider having links that count as a login on that task and expiring them after say a day.  But if you are logged in - which you would be on your phone - then no big deal. 
* Not doing a big office query office every time.  Maybe remember a highwater mark?

# Key commands
* ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -R nagbotapi.shew.net:80:localhost:3978 -R nagbotdev.shew.net:80:localhost:8080 serveo.net
  * Will need ssh key
* docker build -t nagbot .
* docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 3978:3978 nagbot
* alias kube=kubectl
* echo nag=$(kubectl get pods | grep "nag" | cut -d " " -f1)
* kube get logs -l app=nagbot
* Kube get logs -l name=flux

# Archive (project tracking moved to github projects)

# Work items recently completed
* User sets a category (not needed initially on test account) (done)
* Then login to at least one bot and signin. (done)
* Then for "nag marked" incomplete tasks send notifications to associated bot channels. (done)
* Need a simple policy and last nag time.
* To get it running while doing coding that means you probably want a stable conversation store.  (done)
* Maybe put this data on a user Open Extension.  How big can a user extension be? (done)
* The notification contains a URL that leads to the web app - where we assume the user is logged in - that shows the task. (P0)
* The user mark can mark the task as complete.  This should immediately save and you can also click again to mark it not complete 
* Create reminder in bot
* Do we want to put the conversations into Monngo - see ConversationManager2 in conversations.ts? Decision is not for now.
* Do work in branch and PR into main.
* Add a test suite - jest
* UX.  Need one.  Wonder about resurrecting the React Office work.
* UX and data model.  Would be nice to have auto-updating local data - Graph delta queries?  Simplest in the short term is just to get JSON data structures every time.
* P0 - for a given user, store their channels in an open extension. (done)
* P0 - Load persisted conversations at start (done)
* P1 - For "nag marked" incomplete tasks send notifications to associated bot channels according to policy with a simple policy and last nag time.  (done)
* P1 - api/v1.0/me/tasks/id - returns json for task - (done)
* P2 - Store userKey to oid map more persistently. (done)
* P2 - Reattach LUIS (done)
* P3 - Factored interfaces for User. (done)
* P3 - Have a way show all tasks to mark requests as Naggable - for now use Category. (done)
* P1 - Send a Nag with a url to nagbot.shew.net/task/taskid where id is the Outlook Task id and show UX on that task.
* P2 - Mark complete.
* P2 - Host in the cloud.
* P3 - Multiple Nag Policies.
  * Maybe use a "versioned json object".  
  * Start with NagPreference: { nagType: "simple"; timeZoneRelative?: true /* assumes false */ } 
  * This would nag once a week until one week then daily in the morning at 10 am (initially then using preference) then on the day of hourly starting at 10 am (initially)
* P3 - Use nagbot to mark a conversation as persisted for notifications
* P3 - Basic task edit.
